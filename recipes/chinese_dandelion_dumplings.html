    <p id="description">
        I submitted these for the 2009 Dandelion Cook-off at Breitenbach Winery 
        Dandelion Festival. These were a crowd favorite, especially the Asian 
        dipping sauce. If you like dandelion greens, you'll love these. 
        Formed dumplings can be frozen up to 2 months.

        <li>1 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>100 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix pork, dandelion greens, napa cabbage, bok choy, 4 minced green 
            onions, 1 tablespoon of ginger, 3 cloves of garlic, bamboo shoots, 
            3 tablespoons of soy sauce, white pepper, salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 
            and 4 teaspoons of sesame oil. Chill in the refrigerator 6 to 8 hours, 
            or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Beat the egg white with the water in a small bowl and set aside. 
            Place 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into a wonton wrapper, working 
            one at at time. Cover additional wrappers with a moist towel to 
            prevent drying. Brush the edges of the wrapper with the egg white 
            mixture. Fold the wrapper and seal the edges with a moistened fork.
        </li>
        <li>WSpray a large skillet with cooking spray. Heat 2 tablespoons for 
            vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, place the 
            dumplings into the skillet, seam side up. Cook until the dumplings 
            brown slightly, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour 1/2 cup of water into the 
            skillet and cover. Gently steam the dumplings until the oil and water 
            begin to sizzle, 7 to 8 minutes. Once the water is cooked off, flip 
            the dumplings and continue cooking until the bottom begin to brown, 3 
            to 5 minutes. Repeat in batches with the remaining dumplings, oil, and 
            water. Serve with dipping sauce.
        </li>
        <li>To make dipping sauce: Combine chili oil, hoisin sauce, 1/2 cup of 
            soy sauce, 4 teaspoons of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of sugar, balsamic 
            vinegar, 1 teaspoon of ginger, 2 tablespoons of green onion, and 2 
            cloves of garlic in a bowl.
        </li>
    </ol>
